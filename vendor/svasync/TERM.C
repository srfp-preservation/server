/*
	Demo-Term.

	This is a short example of how to use this library.
	The COM port settings are hard coded as defines
	but you don't have to do it this way.  You could read them
	in from a file, etc..

	This this is just a sample program, I didn't take the time
	to emulate any known terminals.  Everything is output through
	DOS, so if you've got ansi.sys loaded, most of the ansi/vt100
	codes should work, but your keyboard isn't going to be
	mapped correctly. (i.e. the arrow keys)

	You can add that yourself if you wish to use this thing
	for anything other than a confirmation that the routines work.

	Have fun,

	Sam
